    <h1>Revelation</h1>
    <h2>by Robert Frost</h2>

    <p>We make ourselves a place apart</p>
    <p>&nbsp; Behind light words that tease and flout,</p>
    <p>But oh, the agitated heart</p>
    <p>&nbsp; Till someone find us really out.</p>
    <br />
    <p>'Tis pity if the case require</p>
    <p>&nbsp; (Or so we say) that in the end</p>
    <p>We speak the literal to inspire</p>
    <p>&nbsp; The understanding of a friend.</p>
    <br />
    <p>But so with all, from babes that play</p>
    <p>&nbsp; At hide-and-seek to God afar,</p>
    <p>So all who hide too well away</p>
    <p>&nbsp;Must speak and tell us there they are.</p>
